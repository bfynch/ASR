Appointment Scheduling and Reservation System by Benjamin Fynch s3589828

This project, Appointment Scheduling and Reservation System, is a console based application designed 
to allow staff members to create and delete booking slots, and for students to book and cancel
those bookings. The application is written in C# and uses a backend database to store all of the
information, ie, users, rooms, and slots.
